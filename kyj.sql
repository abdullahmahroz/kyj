Over 2,000 people attended in person, with hundreds more watching live streams of the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The WordCamp was a great success with plenty of first-time attendees and new WordPress contributors getting involved in the project and community. Recorded sessions from the 65 speakers at the event will be available on WordPress.tv in the coming weeks. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wceu/albums\">photos from the event</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/wordcamp-europe-2019/\">The next WordCamp Europe</a> takes place on June 20-22 2019 in Berlin, Germany. If you’re based in Europe and would like to serve on the organizing team, <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/call-wordcamp-europe-2019-organizers/\">fill in the application form</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updated Roadmap for the New WordPress Content Editor</h2>\n\n<p>During his keynote session at WordCamp Europe, Matt Mullenweg presented <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/mullenweg-on-gutenberg-roll-out-plan/\">an updated roadmap</a> for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>, the new content editor coming in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<p>While the editor is in rapid development, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\">with v3.1 being released this past month</a>, the team is aiming to ship Gutenberg with WordPress Core in August, 2018. This is not set in stone — the release date may shift as development progresses — but this gives the first realistic idea of when we can expect the editor to be released.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contribute to Gutenberg, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">the handbook</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordCamp Incubator Cities Announced</h2>\n\n<p>The WordCamp Incubator program helps spread WordPress to underserved communities by providing organizing support for their first WordCamp. The first iteration of this program ran successfully in 2016 and empowered three cities to start their own WordPress communities.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the Community Team is running the Incubator program again. After receiving applications from 104 communities, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/06/26/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-locations-announcement/\">they have selected</a> Montevideo, Uruguay and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia to participate in the program. Both cities will receive direct help from experienced WordCamp organizers to run their first-ever WordCamp as a way to help their WordPress community get started.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about the Incubator program follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community team blog</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The WordPress community of Spain recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_es/status/1004681694660603904\">received an award</a> for being the best open-source community in the country.</li>\n	<li>This month, WordPress reached <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">the milestone of powering 31% of websites</a>.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://wprig.io/introducing-wprig-wordpress/\">WP Rig</a> is a brand new tool to help WordPress developers build better themes.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/gutenberg-block-unit-test/\">Block Unit Test</a> is a new plugin to help theme developers prepare for Gutenberg.</li>\n	<li>Near the end of the month, Zac Gordon hosted <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\">an online conference</a> focused on JavaScript development in WordPress &#8211; the session videos will be available on YouTube soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"The Month in WordPress: May 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 09:09:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:360:\"This month saw two significant milestones in the WordPress community — the 15th anniversary of the project, and GDPR-related privacy tools coming to WordPress Core.

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

The Community Team has been hard at work helping communities around the world plan local anniversary parties.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">the central anniversary website</a> to see if there’s already a party being planned near you. These parties are all organized by local communities — if there’s no local community in your area, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/#starting-a-new-meetup-com-group\">start one today</a> and host a party yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Work has Started on a Gutenberg Migration Guide</h2>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg, the upcoming WordPress content editor, in rapid development, a lot of people have been wondering how they will convert their existing plugins to work with the new features. To mitigate the issues here and help people overcome any migration hurdles, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/26/your-help-wanted-gutenberg-migration-guide/\">a Gutenberg Migration Guide is underway</a> to assist developers with making their code Gutenberg-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to this guide, you can review <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide\">the existing documentation on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide/issues\">open a new issue</a> if you find something to add.</p>\n\n<h2>Theme Review Team Launches Trusted Authors Program</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of themes submitted to the Theme Directory can take quite a while to complete. In order to combat this issue and to make the theme submission process smoother for everyone, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/04/30/trusted-authors-program/\">the Theme Review Team is introducing a Trusted Authors Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This program will allow frequent and reliable theme authors to apply for trusted status, allowing them to upload themes more frequently and to have their themes automatically approved. This will allow more high-quality themes to be added to the directory, as well as recognize the hard work that authors put in to build their themes.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved with reviewing themes, you can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">their getting started guide</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">team blog</a> and join the #themereview channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 4.9.5 was released</a> early this month, fixing numerous bugs and potential security issues.

Keijonen&#8217;s WordPress.org-hosted themes are active on more than 10,000 websites.</p>\n<p>During the past three years he began taking on more client work, which gave him less time for theme building and maintenance. Last month he accepted a front-end engineer position at 10up that is keeping him busy.</p>\n<p>Fans might remember Keijonen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-mina-olen-free-wordpress-theme-experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Olen Free WordPress Theme Experiment</a> when he made the theme available for free on GitHub to see if potential customers would be inspired to purchase after being able to test drive the theme on their own sites. At that time he said he struggled to support his theme shop, because the business aspect of it wasn&#8217;t one of his strengths.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in all the competition in the WordPress theme industry, especially when major players have more money to drop on advertising and support staff. The days of building a beautiful theme and selling it without any kind of marketing are long gone. Prospective theme developers have to be ready to embrace the challenges of competing in a much wider market in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Foxland isn’t a gold mine,&#8221; Keijonen said in his announcement. &#8220;Foxland brings about 3,000 to 4,000 Euros per year, which is OK but my goal was 10,000 euros.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customers appreciated Keijonen&#8217;s attention to detail, accessibility, and performance. Respected WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://tungdo.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tung Do</a> said Keijonen&#8217;s themes are &#8220;great examples of best practices.&#8221; Many of them also include support for popular plugins.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Checathlon</a>, one of his best works, is active on <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxland.fi</a>. It offers built-in styles for Easy Digital Downloads (including product and account pages), Custom Content Portfolio, and Jetpack (testimonials, portfolio, and email subscription widget).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/themes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Foxland collection</a> includes several beautiful minimalist free themes with previously-pro versions that enable additional Customizer settings, page templates, and widgets. All of Keijonen&#8217;s custom <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> (created to accompany the themes) are also available for free.</p>\n<p>The Foxland shop has cancelled all the recurring subscriptions but will continue to support existing purchases up to a year from the purchase date. Keijonen said he will maintain most of the old themes and plugins with small updates coming in the future but plans to deprecate some as well.</p>\n<p>The landscape of WordPress theming is about to change quite a bit when Gutenberg is merged into core. Keijonen said he plans to embrace these changes by creating new free themes with Gutenberg support, built on more modern code.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 23:46:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: New BackYourStack Tool Drives Financial Support for Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/new-backyourstack-tool-drives-financial-support-for-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2606:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-11-at-5.17.24-PM-e1534026554562.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> launched in 2017 as a new organization that helps groups raise funds and manage them transparently. The service is now widely used by many open source projects. Webpack, one of the first major Open Collective success stories, was able to fund its first full-time developer through the service and is now <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">operating on an estimated annual budget of $331,471</a>. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco WordPress meetup</a> (WPSFO) is one example of a WordPress group that successfully uses the service to <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">receive sponsorships</a> that help cover expenses for events.</p>\n<p>Open Collective has launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://backyourstack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BackYourStack</a> that helps people and organizations become aware of projects they use that need funding. The tool scans GitHub accounts (for individuals and organizations) and identifies projects that have already set up accounts on Open Collective. The tool shows all detected dependencies and the repositories where they are used.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results you get from scanning the WordPress GitHub account:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-11.36.42-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results display where project is used, the number of full-time maintainers, progress to reach the next goal, and a few organizations that are already backing the project. Open Collective also allows backers to support multiple dependences in bulk via a lump sum as an alternative to backing each project individually.</p>\n<p>Not every open source project listed on Open Collective will have the need to fund salaries and events, but even a small yearly budget can reduce out-of-pocket costs for open source maintainers for things like hosting and promotional costs. Many widely used open source projects go without funding because users are not aware of their needs. BackYourStack helps people and organizations make a direct connection to the projects they depend on.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:38:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.5.0 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83084\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-5-0-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1260:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> 3.5.0 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/09/whats-new-in-gutenberg-9th-august/\">is available</a> for download and polishes existing features.

Gutenberg is opening a whole new playing field for us in terms of more in context, actionable feedback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Future versions of Yoast SEO will offer more features inline, instead of housing them in a single meta box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started by breaking down all our features, and seeing where we could integrate them into Gutenberg,&#8221; de Valk said in a <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> outlining Yoast SEO&#8217;s planned approach back in October 2017. &#8220;We don’t think holding on to a single, massive box below the editor will best serve our customers. We’d much rather integrate right where the action happens, and Gutenberg offers us that chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, readability analysis can be shown on a per-block basis to provide more fine-grained feedback:</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/readability-analysis.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\">Yoast SEO</a>\n<p>&#8220;You’ll get actionable feedback in context,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;You don’t have to scroll down to a meta box to see the advice and scroll up again to the place where you should implement it. If we give feedback per block, you will get a better understanding of all the factors that influence SEO.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team has been enthusiastic about what the Gutenberg era will bring to WordPress. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1026084237508788225\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, de Valk summarized his thoughts on the project and described the direction the Yoast SEO plugin is headed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I&#8217;ve] been thinking about Gutenberg more lately, as discussion about it is growing now that it&#8217;s near to WordPress core inclusion. What is most important in what we&#8217;re doing is something I think most people don&#8217;t see yet: The new &#8216;blocks&#8217; that Gutenberg introduces allow us to, much more easily, make content items instead of web pages the smallest particle of the web.</p>\n<p>Questions and answers, how to&#8217;s, recipes, suddenly all of them can much more easily have metadata, and be reused. This is particularly important to SEOs: the search engines, driven by voice search requirements, are searching for answers, more than for &#8216;just&#8217; URLs to send traffic to, and blocks allow us to give them those answers, in a format both they and users can understand. While doing this, it allows us to keep the separation of content and design, something we definitely need to think more about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With Gutenberg compatibility on its way from widely-used plugins like ACF and Yoast SEO, users can have confidence more plugins they depend on will follow suit. These major players are the first cracks in the ice across the ecosystem that will soon make Gutenberg-support the standard for any product that wants to compete.</p>\n<p>de Valk encouraged users to look at the advent of Gutenberg as a door to new opportunities during this transition time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is not &#8216;done,\'&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s ready to ship, but I also think it opens up a world of new opportunities and discussions. It&#8217;s not all &#8216;right&#8217; yet either, so there will have to be changes as more people use it and get used to it. I do realize this is a drastic change in some ways. But it&#8217;s also not half as bad as people think it is. I have seen people use it for the first time, most people get used to it very quickly. Last but not least: you don&#8217;t have to switch now. The classic editor plugin exists for a reason. You can put off your switch for a year, or even two. But eventually I think everyone will see the power of the new editor and will switch.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 21:54:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: Advanced Custom Fields to Add Gutenberg Compatibility in Version 5.0, Slated for September\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/advanced-custom-fields-to-add-gutenberg-compatibility-in-version-5-0-slated-for-september\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4880:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-08-at-10.50.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF) team published an <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/the-state-of-acf-in-a-gutenberg-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> today, assuring users that Gutenberg compatibility is in the works and will be available in version 5.0 of the free version in September 2018. The plugin, created by Elliot Condon, makes it easy for developers to add custom fields to WordPress edit screens, including posts, users, taxonomy terms, and media.</p>\n<p>ACF is widely used with more than a million active installations. Developers have been concerned about whether or not their custom fields would continue to work on their clients&#8217; websites after the new editor makes its debut in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg treats legacy metaboxes as second class citizens in the interface, stuffed at the bottom of the new edit screen. Metaboxes should, however, continue to work as expected. The ACF announcement lets developers know what to expect for how their metaboxes will appear inside Gutenberg:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By default, our beloved metaboxes are pushed all the way to the bottom of the screen in an awkward attempt to retain compatibility. This placement feels very much like an afterthought from the Gutenberg developers and creates a disjointed editing experience for those of us (1+ million awesome ACF users) who extend the edit screens with extra fields.</p>\n<p>While this setup isn’t ideal, we will continue to work within the system to ensure that ACF is integrated into the Gutenberg UI to the fullest extent possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The free version of ACF will introduce Gutenberg compatibility in its version 5 release, which is slated for early September 2018. The compatibility update will only apply to version 5 and later, so the ACF team urges developers to running 4.x to upgrade to 5 as soon as it becomes available. Developers can also elect to upgrade early by turning on ACF&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/upgrade-guide-version-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Early Access</a> feature.</p>\n<p>The most surprising news is that ACF is introducing its own &#8220;ACF Blocks,&#8221; an <code>acf_register_block()</code> function that allows developers to register their own custom blocks without having to learn JavaScript.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the big selling points of Gutenberg is the ability for developers to create custom blocks. The challenge is that the process is very JavaScript-intensive and not so friendly to PHP developers. But never fear, because ACF Blocks is here to turn that narrative upside down!</p>\n<p>We have been hard at work building a PHP friendly game-changer for you to quickly create new block types using ACF fields to power PHP templates!</p></blockquote>\n<p>ACF Blocks may be an unexpected development for those using the plugin, as the ACF team&#8217;s recent tweets have frequently communicated their disappointment with Gutenberg.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just spent the day working with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a>&#8230; <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f915.png\" alt=\"🤕\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f624.png\" alt=\"😤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f626.png\" alt=\"😦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Frustrated, annoyed and surprised at how buggy the editing experience is.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Advanced Custom Fields (@wp_acf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1026724444327178240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The availability of the ACF Blocks function is a strategic move that continues to make ACF indispensable for users who may not have made the time to improve their technical skills with regards to extending Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using ACF to make custom blocks was something I thought could happen, but not necessarily would happen,&#8221; WordPress developer Roy Sivan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royboy789/status/1027199624669327360\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;They proved me wrong, and its a big deal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news should come as a relief for developers who have used ACF liberally on client sites and feel under the gun with Gutenberg&#8217;s proposed time frame for inclusion in core.

Without the right tools, it can be overwhelming to simply get started building even the most basic theme.</p><cite>Justin Tadlock</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>While starter themes are nothing new in the WordPress space, Mythic and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rig-a-wordpress-starter-theme-and-build-process-in-one\">WP Rig</a> take things to the next level and relatively share the same goal of providing a modern foundation to develop on top of. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the inspiration to build Mythic began two years ago. In trying to revamp the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/news/\">News theme</a>, Tadlock became frustrated with how difficult it was to use old coding methods and dropped the project.<br />><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#8220;In a lot of ways, it was the catalyst that started me down this road toward Mythic,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time. But, that&#8217;s where some of my frustration began with modern theme building.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic supports PHP 5.6+ although Tadlock is strongly pushing developers towards PHP 7+. &#8220;Anything earlier than 5.6 means for clunky code that’s just a headache to maintain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;WordPress, as a community, needs to be pushing people to update.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Support for SASS, LESS, CSS, and Stylus are built-in and developers can choose which language they prefer for builds. ES6+ was chosen for JavaScript and is commonly used for building Gutenberg blocks. </p>\n\n<p>Mythic comes with <a href=\"http://getbem.com/\">BEM</a> or Block-Element-Modifier. BEM is a methodology that enables developers to create reusable elements and sharing code in front-end environments. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;BEM is a popular solution because it goes hand-in-hand with modern CSS pre-processors,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It also allows you to keep your styles flat and not get lost in <em>specificity hell</em>. This means smaller, faster stylesheets that are easier to override when you, a child theme author, or user need to do something custom.&#8221; The starter theme uses <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> in combination with <a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix\">Laravel Mix</a> to manage assets and modules.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Mythic has an <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/working-with-the-view-class\">extended View class</a> that allows theme authors to use their preferred folder structure. Theme authors can also add custom data to theme templates. According to Tadlock, both features are not part of WordPress&#8217; native templating system. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to Mythic, Tadlock has continued to work on the <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\">Hybrid Core </a>framework. Hybrid Core is a required dependency that is added via Composer. </p>\n\n<p>Using Mythic with Hybrid Core exposes developers to features of the framework that they otherwise may not discover. &#8220;I rewrote nearly all of HC5 from scratch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a result, it’s leaner, more organized, and more cohesive.&#8221; The starter theme is also Gutenberg-ready.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Tadlock Experiments with Sponsorship Pricing Model<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Mythic is in open beta and available for free via <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/mythic\">GitHub</a>. The <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/themes/mythic\">pricing model</a> is an honor system experiment. Tadlock is asking those who build projects for clients and generating a profit, to make a $99 sponsorship purchase. For commercially-sold themes, he is asking for $199. Both packages come with one year of support and access to the company&#8217;s Slack channel. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still taking feedback on the payment system,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It could change. There have been a few suggestions more of a lifetime/flat fee. I&#8217;d prefer to just get some generous sponsors and keep it all $free. We&#8217;ll see where that goes in this next month of the beta process.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic&#8217;s beta ends on September 3rd in which he&#8217;ll release version 1.0. Until then, he is trying to get as much feedback as possible from developers.

This new module ports WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor over to Drupal. It was created by Per André Rønsen and his team <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, a digital services agency based in Norway.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project aims to provide a new publishing experience based on WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor. The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the site currently provides a frontend interactive implementation of Gutenberg inside Drupal, similar to WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; demo on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.org/gutenberg</a>. The latest implementation of the module will appear there but Rønsen said it is currently being revamped, as lots of things have happened with Gutenberg in the past few weeks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drupal-gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>How the Drupal Gutenberg Project was Born</h3>\n<p>Rønsen told us he first saw Gutenberg in 2017 and was inspired to use it for one of Frontkom&#8217;s media clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thought of forking it came mid-2017, as we explored using Gutenberg as a lib for making a front page builder sponsored by the Google Digital News Initiative,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;We ended up using it, and the Drupal module is a natural spin off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom tailored the Gutenberg-based page builder for the media industry. It adds extra functionality to Gutenberg that allows users to position and tweak articles for the front page of an online newspaper. Rønsen said the project went well and his team plans to open source it but it&#8217;s too early to share anything right now.</p>\n<p>Following this successful experience using Gutenberg for a client, Frontkom began work on the Drupal Gutenberg project in early January 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main part of the work was to make Gutenberg more CMS agnostic,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;First we forked it and maintained a fork. Later we started using Gutenberg as a dependency, testing a more maintainable approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen opened a ticket on GitHub, requesting that the Gutenberg team consider <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">structuring the project to be more CMS-agnostic</a>. The ticket was closed fairly soon with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780#issuecomment-342569414\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explanation</a> that it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t relate directly to the work going on with the project and its goals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very little, if any, upstream commits so far, as the WP core interest has been to just cater to WP needs so far,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But that just changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is moving towards making it easier to use outside of WordPress. The team is working on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3955\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">publishing all the React modules as npm packages</a>. Rønsen said he anticipates that decreasing the number of globals needed to make Gutenberg work will be a huge help for other CMSs.</p>\n<p>So far the Drupal Gutenberg project has not been shared widely but Rønsen said his team has seen a lot of interest from the Drupal tech community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a blog post coming in English with more detail; we kind of saved it for after holidays,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But then it blew up, and devs keep contacting us wanting to help out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom has been involved in the Drupal community for more than 10 years and WordPress for the past three years. Rønsen and his team believe that Gutenberg fills a gap in the Drupal space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal doesn&#8217;t have all those fancy WordPress page builders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that is really more interesting than just a new post edit UI – we want a unified way to build complex layouts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drupal already has an initiative for revamping its admin UI using React, and Rønsen said he thinks Gutenberg might contribute to how this can happen in Drupal core. In an ideal world, many open source projects could greatly benefit from a CMS-agnostic Gutenberg, with all of them contributing together towards its improvement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To us as a company, it is extremely interesting to build out front-ends that can easily be moved between CMSs,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;For open source CMSs in general, I think there will be a lot to learn from the implementation process. For example, D8 has the concept of &#8216;everything is a block.&#8217; This has made it easy for us to make Drupal core blocks available in Gutenberg – we just need to do some magic to expose block settings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Frontkom team are not only enthusiastic fans of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface, but also appreciate the way the project is run. Rønsen hasn&#8217;t been following the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-garners-mixed-reactions-from-new-wave-of-testers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community reaction to the latest round of Gutenberg testing</a> but said he thinks WordPress users will love it long term, since &#8220;most of the page builders out there have issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal can learn a lot from WordPress, the way they actually built the Gutenberg project – a transparent design process, lots of collaboration, and still highly efficient,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;So, WordPress is definitely ahead of Drupal with regards to their admin UI/JS work. Since there is already a lot of interest in the Drupal community to do something similar, it is very refreshing to see someone go through it and succeed (hopefully).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Persch</a>, lead developer advocate at Pantheon, spoke at DrupalCon in Nashville 2018 about <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/whats-possible-wordpress-50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">what&#8217;s possible with WordPress 5.0</a> and also gave a session at Twin Cities Drupal Camp titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/everything-block-how-wordpress-rewrote-wysiwyg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Everything is a Block: How WordPress Rewrote the WYSIWYG</a>.&#8221; In response to buzz on Twitter about the Drupal Gutenberg session, Persch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector/status/1026461967630983169\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Drupal needs an editorial UX improvement to stay competitive, but not necessarily by adopting Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have in-progress initiatives toward that end,&#8221; Persch said. &#8220;Gutenberg itself could turn into a distraction from that work. In both [presentations] I also mentioned that Paragraphs or Layout Builder could be better data model starting points for Gutenberg-like functionality. Delivering exactly the same thing as WordPress would be self-defeating. Structured content is the heart of Drupal. I see Gutenberg (or something like it) as a better UI for the corner of the data model (the Paragraphs part) that Drupal sites have had for years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how different open source communities approach Gutenberg and how more diverse feedback from outside of WordPress could impact the project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/marcofernandes/2981601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg module</a> can be downloaded from the project page.

The invitation has already succeeded at pulling out some quality feedback if you can sort through all the casual, angry one-liners.</p>\n<p>Steven Peters opened a lengthy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/in-one-word-no-please-read-full-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> with the following observations about the more cumbersome and unintuitive aspects of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface is not cohesive in its design. For example, To place a block of a paragraph, a heading, a subheading, a bullet list and every other block, the user must click the + sign every single time, making it that much harder to ‘go with the flow’ of writing, and is cumbersome and time-consuming. Time-consuming: a click for each block instead of just writing. More clicks equal wasted time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/lots-of-potential-but-too-soon-for-core/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lots of potential but too soon for core</a>,&#8221; Mark Wilkinson details several specific usability issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface I find confusing – I think it is because it is too minimal. I found that it was all too easy to add a block by mistake and then not knowing what the block was or why it was there.</p>\n<p>There is too much reliance on hover effects, with things appearing and disappearing all the time. I also find it hard to know where the focus is on the screen as it just uses a faint grey border.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several reviewers were candid about their distaste for the concept of putting content into blocks. The Gutenberg team has readily communicated its vision for the block-based editor, but this tends to speak more to developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why does every little thing have to be in a separate block?&#8221; one reviewer <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/im-not-change-resistant-but-this-has-a-way-to-go/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> before describing multiple usability issues with current block behavior. &#8220;That is a feature I think I actually detest. I do not want 50 zillion little fussy blocks on a page. I had entire blocks just disappear on me and a lot of the time, I was initially unsure of exactly what I did to make them disappear. This is bad. Some of the time it was placing a block, like an image block, and then deleting the image … the entire block went, which meant I had to go through the motions to add the block, then add an image block again, and then add my image again. Lame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple reviewers commented that previously simple tasks are much more complicated in Gutenberg. Others said after reading official replies to reviews, they felt that leaving specific feedback was a waste of time. Canned responses from the Gutenberg team gave some the impression that their feedback wasn&#8217;t heard or valued.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My feeling while reading the WordPress developer responses is that that they have no intention of either stopping or postponing Gutenberg no matter what bug or problem is given to their attention. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/can-i-just-interject-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lauritasita</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I have read all the reviews (and also the Gutenberg-lovers’ replies) and it seems that it is not really a discussion. The question on what is missing in this editor is useless if people simply do not want such a feature in their install. All you do is trying to convince people that it would only take time to get used to a modern technology. In my eyes this is bullshit. I myself love new features – if they are useful. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/time-to-respect-your-users-matt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@peg20</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Based on the responses to reviews, it isn&#8217;t clear to testers whether the Gutenberg team is willing to make major changes to re-design features that are not easy to use or whether they are simply combing the reviews for feedback on bugs with the existing interface.</p>\n<h3>Classic Editor Plugin Installations are on the Rise as Users Prepare for WordPress 5.0</h3>\n<p>In the days following WordPress 4.9.8&#8217;s release, active installations of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin have jumped from 7,000 to 60,000, a 757% increase. However, none of these figures in isolation can tell the whole story of users&#8217; experience with the new editor.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1986704551391749/?comment_id=1986914094704128&reply_comment_id=1986943451367859&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response to criticism</a> on the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, Gutenberg contributor Gary Pendergast said he doesn&#8217;t see users installing the Classic Editor plugin as a negative reaction. &#8220;People ensuring that their site is ready for WordPress 5.0 is absolutely a good thing,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;For a lot of sites, that means sticking with their current workflows for now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast also said the growing number of Classic Editor installs is a good indication that WordPress users are &#8220;proactively maintaining their sites, and a reasonable indication that they intend to upgrade to WordPress 5.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;People certainly have strong feelings about it, and &#8216;fear of change&#8217; is absolutely a legitimate feeling: we need to provide the right tools to empower everyone who uses WordPress,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;Some people will jump right into the brave new block-based world, some people will prefer to use the Classic Editor plugin as a way to keep their existing workflows. When WordPress 5.0 lands, neither way should be seen as the &#8216;correct&#8217; way &#8211; they&#8217;re both entirely legitimate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One major theme in both positive and negative reviews of the plugin is the desire for Gutenberg to be opt-in for WordPress 5.0, instead of having it auto-enabled for all users.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The \"Try Gutenberg\" callout in WordPress 4.9.8 looks great!

For millions of other WordPress users without their own developers or engineering teams, discovering Gutenberg auto-enabled after updating to WordPress 5.0 will be a moment of reckoning.

Up until this point, only the most curious and motivated WordPress users have taken Gutenberg for a spin. Widespread testing has just begun and we&#8217;re not yet seeing a complete picture of how well the new editor will be received.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initial impression</a>, after first trying it a year ago, was that Gutenberg is the most exciting thing to happen to WordPress in a long time. After reading hundreds of negative reviews, I still believe in the block concept but am convinced that Gutenberg needs to deliver a beautiful writing experience in order to win people over.</p>\n<p>If WordPress is my home for writing on the web, I want to feel at home in the interface. I don&#8217;t want to have to hunt for actions buried two-clicks deep. When I use the editor I want to have the feeling of &#8220;I love writing here.&#8221; Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t deliver that yet.</p>\n<p>WordPress has an opportunity to provide the best writing experience on the web, instead of relegating it to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bear-app-users-want-wordpress-publishing-integration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">myriad of dedicated writing apps</a> that don&#8217;t have publishing capabilities.

WordPress.com is working with them and other partners to <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/25823/posts/1945569908\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">make more diverse images available to users</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stock-image libraries have historically struggled to represent all experiences, and often excluded photos of people of color, people with disabilities, or non-binary individuals. Pexels is working to change that, and since partnering with them we’ve helped incorporate diversity-focused libraries to their collection. Ultimately, we believe it’s on us to help find a solution to this problem, and avoid generic stock images that often perpetuate stereotypes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com users can access the images via the Add Media button. Self-hosted site owners with Jetpack-enabled sites can also access the library when composing new posts on WordPress.com. Automattic happiness engineer Anne McCarthy posted a demo of where to find the new images:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/c-ZzCzFS1Rn\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/mJOr5iicyD.gif?resize=627%2C348&ssl=1\" alt=\"Media\" width=\"627\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>More than 1,000 developers and companies are using the <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels API</a>. The site regularly hosts diversity-focused photo <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/challenges/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">challenges</a> with prizes for the best submissions. Photographers who are inspired to contribute can submit their work to the library but should be aware of its <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo-license\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open license</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the idea, and, as a photoblogger, I’m open to sharing my images,&#8221; one reader commented on the announcement. &#8220;But I [think] the license rules are too open (for me). I’m happy to share, attribution would be nice (not necessary), but editing of my photos seems a step too far.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Feedback on the library has been overwhelmingly positive so far and WordPress.com users have already downloaded more than 1 million images since the free stock image library was introduced.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:45:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9.8 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6165\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/08/wordpress-4-9-8-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9492:\"<p>We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.9.8.  This maintenance release fixes 46 bugs, enhancements and blessed tasks, including updating the Twenty Seventeen bundled theme.</p>\n<p><span>Following are the highlights of what is now available.</span></p>\n<h2>“Try Gutenberg” callout</h2>\n<p><span>Most users will now be presented with a notice in their WordPress dashboard.

The passes come with a single license that provide access to a group of extensions. The prices for each pass were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: $199</li><li>Extended Pass: $399</li><li>Professional Pass: $699</li><li>All Access Pass: $899</li></ul>\n\n<p>After six weeks, Williamson noticed that customers were continuing to purchase individual extensions instead of the passes. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Our expectation and intent in creating the passes was for store owners to be able to purchase access to multiple individual extensions in a more economical way, but that’s not what happened,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead, store owners continued to purchase only the individual extensions they needed because the price tags of the passes were still too high. It is clear that we made a mistake in our pass pricing, and so today we’d like to apologize for that and announce new, lower prices.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>After two weeks of testing, the prices of each pass have been significantly reduced to the following amounts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: <strong>$99</strong></li><li>Extended Pass: <strong>$199</strong></li><li>Professional Pass: <strong>$299</strong></li><li>All Access Pass: <strong>$499</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>In addition to the pricing changes, customers who purchased a pass between June 1st and August 1st are eligible for a refund. The refund is equal to the difference of the purchased price and the new price. Customers have until August 15th, to <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/support\">request a refund</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Customers who purchased passes before the reduction will have their renewal amounts automatically changed to the lower price. </p>\n\n<p>Pricing WordPress products and services is tough and requires experimentation. There are numerous <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=pricing\">WordCamp sessions</a>, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-price-a-product-wordpress/\">articles</a>, and <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/pricing-your-wordpress-services/\">in-depth guides</a> on the subject but there&#8217;s not one answer that&#8217;s best for every business. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly admitting to a pricing mistake is one thing, but offering refunds to try to get customers on equal footing is going the extra mile.</p>\n\n<p>The company could have handled things in a way that&#8217;s not as beneficial to customers, but they chose what I think is a commendable way. Williamson&#8217;s closing statement speaks about the way he leads his company and how he makes these types of decisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>While we are far from perfect, as this pricing mistake clearly indicates, we are dedicated to doing right by our customers. To each of you, we would like to extend our most sincere thanks for sticking with us as we work through these changes</p><cite>Pippin Williamson</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a luxury to have business owners like Williamson in the WordPress economy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 01:00:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.4 Adds New Warning to Classic Editor When Editing Posts Containing Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-4-adds-new-warning-to-classic-editor-when-editing-posts-containing-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2614:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/whats-new-in-gutenberg-30th-july/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.4</a> was released yesterday with fixes intended to prepare the plugin for converting existing content to blocks.

I realized that, as a mother consumed with caring for this new human, I was beginning to lose the very strong sense of identity that I’d always had.</p>\n<p>This was my first experience with not knowing who I was. I always knew who I was, even if I didn’t know who I wanted to be. As a mother though, most of who I am was sucked into caring for my family. Not sleeping. Not taking proper care of myself. Not taking time for my interests. Putting the others in my house before me and saying that it was what I wanted.</p>\n<p><em>Narrator: It wasn’t.</em></p>\n<p>There was a pivot point. A moment before my daughter turned three. When I realized that if she were to choose to become a mother I would not want her to go down the same path of self denial that I had. I would want her to be who she is first and a mother second so that she could be the best self and mother she could be.</p>\n<p>And I realized that was something I could only show by example. But how to start? I’d always been a writer. I often say that I only learned to read so that I could write. Journaling, short stories, poetry. Sometimes just long strings of thoughts and observations that wouldn’t leave my head until I wrote them down. I would write out long “stories” on MySpace about my experiences and realizations. I would scrawl poetry on scrap paper laying around the house. None of it was enough.</p>\n<p>Also, as I understand is fairly typical for a stay at home parent, I had no one to talk to most of the time except for my small child. And while she was super awesome and receptive to any conversation I may want to start, they all tended to transition to discussion of My Little Ponies or a request for ice cream or screen time. So I looked for something more. For a place to discuss the mommified version of myself with no one and everyone. I started a blog.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Go On…</h2>\n<p>I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. My experiences, my kid’s experiences. Dreams and hopes and bad poetry. And I found a group of people who shared with me their struggles and dreams as they dove into mine. A web of women and men who got me. Who got what I was going through. Who got what I was doing. A community of individuals, not all like minded, but all understanding.</p>\n<p>And then one day I was asked to write for a city blog, and then another. And as my writing began to expand I found other communities. My sense of self was first preserved but then invigorated and it grew and I stretched my arms and I stretched my wings and I realized I was beginning to feel whole for the first time in a long while.</p>\n<p>But using multiple platforms for my blogging gave me the understanding that the platform I was using was restrictive and unsatisfying. Clunky.</p>\n<p>And that’s when a friend mentioned WordCamp Portland. It was this new thing. We were doing it for the first time. A bunch of bloggers getting together to talk about WordPress and blogging and stuff.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what WordPress was. But my friend said they needed some volunteers to help out, and I’m always one to support my friends, my community. So I asked what I needed to do to help.</p>\n<p>“Move your blog to WordPress”</p>\n<p>And so I did. And something clicked. Once I had moved to a WordPress site I found my passion for blogging was something more. I played with themes, I made headers that felt like art pieces, I helped others transfer their content, set up their sites. I introduced them to a community that I was just beginning to get to know.</p>\n<p>And then there was a cascade of activity. More blogs, podcasting, events, community, and every year there was WordCamp Portland. And I continued to learn and grow my skills as a writer, as a blogger, as a podcaster, and as a WordPresser. I continued to volunteer, and then to speak, and to help organize.</p>\n<h2>And on…</h2>\n<p>But life changes. Sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. But change is hard. People change or stay the same. Relationships change. Life changes. Sometimes all of the above. So I ended a marriage and found myself stumped. I knew who I was, but who I happened to be was a stay at home mom who hadn’t worked outside the home in eight years and had no marketable skills that I could find that would also allow me to continue to be home for my kid.</p>\n<p>And I panicked and I procrastinated and then I found an opening. A small startup I knew through my interactions with the community needed a customer support person who also knew WordPress.</p>\n<p>A light went on. And I had a job for the first time in eight years. And I knew what I was doing. And I was good at it. And I continued to blog. A little. And I stuck to the little tiny fringes of the WordPress community I knew. Still not realizing how big the rest of it was.</p>\n<p>The Portland WordPress folks were like a river feeding into the ocean of the worldwide community. But I’d only ever stood on the shores of the river and dipped my toes in. All that was about to change.</p>\n<h2>Till You Come to the End…</h2>\n<p>But as I said at the beginning, it’s not that simple. There is no end. There is just more. More stories, more people, more learning, more community. And that’s where we begin the part of the story that tells us where I am today.</p>\n<p>This part begins with an email from a community friend with a link to a job posting. And a new beginning.</p>\n<p>I was working happily at that small startup, spreading my wings. But starting to feel a little bit like my passion wasn’t being put to use when that email arrived. A link to a job posting working as a sponsored volunteer within the WordPress community and question. It was a simple question. “Do you know anyone who would kick ass at this job?”</p>\n<p>DID I? I was reeling from the possibility and doubled over with imposter syndrome and fear. Fear that I wasn’t good enough. Fear that they wouldn’t like me. Fear that I’d be leaving my boss in the lurch.</p>\n<p>So I did what I always did at that time. And what I still do to this day. I procrastinated. I talked. I thought. I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic thinking I had forgotten something. Thinking I had done something wrong.</p>\n<p>But as I sat there one day tinkering on the startup’s site, scheduling posts, checking in on our customers all while getting my daughter ready for school that morning I realized that it was time to set aside those fears. To look that imposter syndrome right in the eye and say “not today” and I started putting together my resume and working on the cover email.</p>\n<p>No one was more surprised than I when I found myself two months later starting my first day at Automattic.</p>\n<p>It’s been about 5 and a half years since that email landed in my inbox. It’s been more than a decade since WordPress landed in my heart and I’m proud to make my living in the wide wonderful world of WordPress. As I write this story for all of you to read—not a cautionary tale I hope, but an inspirational one—I’m just a few days away from the end of my three-month sabbatical (a benefit that all Automatticians are eligible for after 5 years.)</p>\n<p>It’s been a time of rest, readjustment, relaxation. Of edification. But it’s also been a renewal. A time to look back at how I got where I am and remember how lucky I am to be here today. And I owe it all to a little bit of gumption and to the amazing community of WordPressers who opened their world to me. And also to everyone else who is willing to be a part of this great big community founded on open source. On WordPress.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Begin%20at%20the%20Beginning&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F&title=Begin+at+the+Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080118-150x150.jpg&description=Begin at the Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\" title=\"Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\">Begin at the Beginning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Aug 2018 08:00:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Cami Kaos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.8 RC 3 Released, Limits ‘Try Gutenberg’ Callout Visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82803\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-8-rc-3-released-limits-try-gutenberg-callout-visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1701:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.8 Release Candidate 3 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/wordpress-4-9-8-release-candidate-3/\">is available</a> for testing.

In April, the platform <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> sweeping changes to the publish_actions permission, which allowed apps to publish to users&#8217; timeline on their behalf.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On August 1st, 2018, the Live API publish_actions permission, which allows an app to publish on behalf of its Users, will be reserved for approved partners. A new permission model that allows apps to publish Videos to their User&#8217;s Groups and Timeline will be created instead.</p>\n<p>Access to the Pages APIs requires re-submission of the application for review before August 1, 2018. This will be required to continue publishing live and VOD video to Pages, as well as reading insights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook is notorious for swiftly changing its APIs in ways that break apps (sometimes without warning), often sending developers scrambling. For a long time, apps auto-posting to user timelines was part of the wild west of app permissions granted without much oversight from Facebook. Users often unknowingly gave permission to apps that would collect data and spam their Facebook connections with posts made on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Those days are over, but an unfortunate byproduct of this restriction is that apps like WordPress.com and Jetpack&#8217;s Publicize feature can no longer automatically publish posts to user timelines. This change also adversely affects apps like Buffer and Hootsuite that allow users to schedule and publish posts to their social accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2018/07/30/jetpack-6-3-3-facebook-publicize/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 6.3.3</a> removes the ability for users to select Facebook Profile connections and displays a notice regarding existing connections, so users will be aware of which auto-posting connections they are losing. Besides Jetpack, this Facebook API change affects tens of thousands of users who have this functionality implemented through one of many other plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Users are now required to manually share their posts to their timelines. They can no longer schedule content to be shared to Facebook at specific times for different audiences.</p>\n<p>Auto-posting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Pages</a> still works, and one option users have is to convert their Profile to a Page or set up a new page. This may not be a suitable alternative for bloggers and those whose writing is not attached to a business or an organization.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on his blog, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn off auto-posting to profiles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As it turns out, Facebook also is turning off the ability for WordPress sites — and all websites — to post directly to users’ profile pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The decision to shut down the API is ostensibly to fight propaganda and misinformation on the platform, but I think it’s a big step back for their embrace of the open web. I hope they change their minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If only a select few &#8220;approved partners&#8221; are allowed to automatically broadcast to user timelines, it puts smaller players at a disadvantage, requiring manual sharing each time they publish. Facebook is setting itself up as a gatekeeper that enables news from a small selection of partners to keep pumping through the platform on schedule. Individual voices on smaller websites are no longer able to syndicate to the Facebook platform unless they decide to create a Page.</p>\n<p>Put a different way, the only syndicated content allowed on Facebook will be through channels the company can monetize &#8211; business/organization Pages or partners who are approved to post to user timelines. Users who care about retaining their Facebook audiences will need to remember to manually post their content to the social network after August 1, 2018, when the API changes go into effect.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:11:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: My Recode Decode Interview with Kara Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1780:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We want to make the best tools in the world, and we want to do it for decades to come.

The Gutenberg handbook has an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/theme-support/\">excellent article</a> on how to opt-in and add support for enhanced features.</p>\n\n<p>Most themes will present the default blocks without any issues as the blocks themselves provide their own styles. If you use a theme that does not fully support Gutenberg such as the Wide or Full Block Alignment options, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-support-for-gutenberg/\">Theme Support for Gutenberg</a> plugin may be for you. </p>\n\n<p>Created by <a href=\"https://weavertheme.com/about/\">Weweaver</a>, Theme Support for Gutenberg claims to allow most WordPress themes to be compatible with Gutenberg. In addition to theme support, the plugin adds a Classic Editor button to the admin bar to easily switch between Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n<p>Since a default WordPress theme is used to show how this plugin is beneficial, I decided to try it for myself. I installed the plugin on a fresh install of WordPress 4.9.7, Gutenberg 3.3, and the latest version of Twenty Sixteen. I published a Gutenberg Demo post which uses many of the default blocks.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Looks Better Without It<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Here is what the Gallery block looks like in Twenty Sixteen with the plugin disabled. The content looks good and fits within the content column.</p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Disabled\n\n<p>When the plugin is enabled, the images are so large, a horizontal scroll bar appears. </p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Enabled\n\n<p>The plugin includes additional styling for default blocks. One block that doesn&#8217;t benefit from the enhanced styles is the Video block. With the plugin disabled, the video block appears normally. </p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Disabled<br />\n\n<p>With the plugin enabled, the video block overflows the content column and breaches into the left sidebar.</p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Enabled \n\n<p>Although the plugin initially shipped with no options, version 0.2 includes new settings that provide better compatibility for some themes. I checked the box to disable Fitvids support which solved the video block issue. However, the other options had no effect on the oversized image blocks. <br /></p>\n\n<img />Theme Support Options\n\n<p>Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen do not work well with this plugin. There may be themes, particularly older ones that benefit, but more modern themes will likely be ok without it. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:42:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Virtual WooCommerce Conference to be Held October 18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82508\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-virtual-woocommerce-conference-to-be-held-october-18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4964:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woosesh-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a>, a new two-day virtual conference focused on WooCommerce topics, will be held October 18-19. While wrapping up another successful edition of WordSesh, Brian Richards announced WooSesh as the next event coming under the WordSesh brand. On Wednesday, nearly 500 attendees joined WordSesh. People tuned in from around the world, although the audience was heavily US-based due to the time the event was scheduled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wordsesh-july-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Since WooConf is not happening this year, WooSesh is an exciting alternative that will be accessible to anyone in the world. Co-organizers Brian Richards and Patrick Rauland will be hosting eight presentations each day, so the event will last between 8-10 hours both days, including breaks and announcements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we learned that WooConf wouldn’t be taking place this year we reached out to our friends at Automattic to see if we could work with them as well to still provide a high-quality event but for a much more global audience,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is sponsoring the entire event, making it free for all live attendees. Richards said they are working with other prominent companies in the WooCommerce space who are lending their knowledgeable staff as presenters, as well as providing the event with digital swag for attendees.</p>\n<p>WooSesh organizers are employing an interesting concept for encouraging attendance and engagement. The conference will have a $200 ticket price for those who do not attend live. Those who register in advance and attend live will receive the $200 ticket for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That means if a person joins the mailing list and shows up for the event, they’ll be able to experience the whole thing at no cost to them,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Similar to WordSesh, a ticket grants attendees access to the entire broadcast, chat, recordings, real-time transcriptions, and some cool digital swag. But with WooSesh they’ll also get some targeted follow-up content, and perhaps a private community, to further help them succeed and increase the impact of this conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I think it’s in everyone’s best interest to register and attend live – at least trying to make it to one of the sessions across the two days – so they can get all of that for free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said recordings may still make it out there for people to view afterwards but none of the other perks and follow-ups will be available without purchasing a ticket or attending live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We talked about asking people for a credit card up front and building a mechanism that would either charge them after the fact (like a pre-order) or charge them up-front but then refund them after the fact,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Instead we’re going with the simpler route and asking only for a person’s name and email address up-front. If they come to the live event they’ll be able to access all of the content afterwards just as if they had paid, and if they don’t attend live they’ll instead be greeted with a payment form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Building on their collective knowledge of organizing successful in-person and virtual conferences, Richards said he and his co-organizer wanted to reduce the friction as much as possible for people getting into their seats and engaged with the speakers and other attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it a virtual event already knocks down a ton of barriers,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Making the content available for free eliminates even more.

The open source vector icon font is used on more than <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Font-Awesome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">22 million sites</a> across the internet. It&#8217;s also a popular icon font with WordPress theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>Version 5.2 introduces automotive and education categories, which should be useful to fill the gaps for designers and developers creating sites around these subjects. The release also adds 66 new and updated icons to the Medical category and 126 new and updated Maps icons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/medical.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Font Awesome, originally created by Dave Gandy, is an SIL OFL-licensed icon font, with the code under the MIT License. Thanks to its GPL-friendly license, the icon font is widely used in WordPress&#8217; theme and plugin ecosystem in both commercial and free products. Font Awesome&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Github issues queue</a> is also loaded with icon requests that would be used in niche WordPress themes, as well as icons for WordPress-related company logos.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Font Awesome announced the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/font-awesome-cdn-now-in-beta-loads-icons-asynchronously-with-automatic-accessibility-best-practices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta release of its new CDN</a>, which allows developers to implement it using a single line of code to bring the icons and CSS toolkit into their projects. At that time, Font Awesome was used by more than 300 plugins on WordPress.org. In 2018, searching the official plugin directory turns up more than 800 plugins that make use of the icon font in some way. Thousands of free and commercial themes also use it to provide users with easy customization options.</p>\n<p>Font Awesome support for Gutenberg is going to be fairly important, as hundreds of thousands of websites are using plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Font Awesome</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome Shortcodes</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-4-menus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome for Menus</a> to allow users to add icons to content and menus.

In 2015, the Metadata UI project <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/\">was reborn</a> as the <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api\">Fields API</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Fields API was developed to allow registering fields to different screens in the admin area through a single API. New meta boxes and fields within them could be added to posts while new sections and fields could be added to the profile screen.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the API is to integrate with all of the various admin screens including, Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments and provide standardization.</p>\n\n<p>Clark has been leading the project for three years and despite seeing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-fields-api-project-sees-renewed-interest\">renewed interest</a> last year, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C04MWK7PZ/\">announced</a> in the project&#8217;s Slack channel that he is stepping down. <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is with a heavy heart that I must pass the torch on this project.

I still believe to be such a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future success.</p><cite>Scott Kingsley Clark</cite></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The Trials and Tribulations of Leading an Open Source Project</h2>\n\n<p>In the following interview, Clark explains why he feels personally responsible for the project&#8217;s lack of progress, why the API is important for WordPress&#8217; future, and reflects on what he could have done differently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you looking to pass the torch on to anyone in particular?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m not sure who would have the drive and the clout to see the project through. It&#8217;s a large scale project that should be approached with a long-term vision but in small enough increments to make it into WordPress core. It&#8217;s a lot to ask of somebody, it&#8217;s also not a priority for people right now since they are distracted by Gutenberg being released in the near future.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is the Fields API a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>People look at WordPress today and wonder how they ever survived without the REST API. Well, at least I know I do! The same thing can be said about the Fields API even though it&#8217;s not there yet. There are so many cases where it&#8217;s frustrating to build solutions for WordPress across all of the different hooks.<br /></p>\n\n<p>For consistency, it&#8217;s the wild west out there. You get a meta box registered and you fill it with whatever you want. You need your own CSS to style the form fields and everyone has their own idea of how this interface should look. You are in charge of your own responsive layouts that are mobile-friendly, there&#8217;s just so much you have to handle on your own. You should be able to customize appearances, but every place you want to add a field or form to should really have a proper API.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Long-term, imagine registering fields to WordPress like you register post types. Imagine fields and their configurations being available to the REST API and accessible through the WordPress App or other custom apps. </p>\n\n<p>The whole world opens up because you have a consistent API, the whole world make sense because you have a consistent interface for those fields across the various edit screens. Posts, terms, comments, users, media, even the Customizer would all have the same underlying API to add groups, panels, and fields to their screens.<br /></p>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg was done after the Fields API was in, migration for folks wouldn&#8217;t have been as difficult. Gutenberg could have automatically shown all of the Fields API interfaces like it does for the meta box backward compatibility. It would have looked so much nicer too.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking some time to reflect, what could you have done differently to get more core contributors to buy into the project and turn it into a higher priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure, it&#8217;s a delicate balance of taking input and being confident in the end result. At first, the feedback was about how the API was foreign for WordPress, they asked if it could be similar in structure to other APIs such as the Customizer. </p>\n\n<p>We scrapped the code and rebuilt from the ground up as a fork of the Customizer, it even supported having the Customizer utilizing the Fields API too. At the height of development, we had all areas of the Fields API implemented.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Core releases were moving pretty fast, there was a lot of code changes from WordPress release to release that we had to keep up with because we had essentially created a project that was a giant patch for WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>There weren&#8217;t enough hooks in place to do what we needed to do, and many sections were not extensible because of code decisions that marked themselves as &#8216;final&#8217;, which means you can&#8217;t extend a specific class to customize how it works.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I wish I could have been at all the big WordCamps in the US and Europe, essentially lobbying for this feature. Gathering supporters and such, it feels like politics in a way. I hung around in Core dev meetings, trying to bring it up. I tried to legitimize the feature by having a dedicated channel in the official WordPress Slack, posting updates on<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> https://make.wordpress.org/core/</a>, and holding weekly meetings.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I prioritized my time for development over the time to gather the troops. That was the downfall, I began to burn out quickly after the first few rewrites as I had many other responsibilities elsewhere on top of Fields API.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not like companies will easily want to pay you to work on a project like this indefinitely, even though both WebDevStudios and 10up gave me time to push it forward. It wasn’t a blank check, at some point I had to get back to billable work. From then on, it was all in my free time and that was difficult to manage during times of financial stress and house selling/buying.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s demand for a Fields API in core but not enough hands to build it. Why do you think that is?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Everyone is focused elsewhere. There’s a lot of areas of WordPress that need people’s attention. There are things like Accessibility that deserve a lot more attention than it gets. But the focus to me, seems to be on Gutenberg and REST API. </p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg especially has been a huge time sink for people contributing and people implementing. It’s a really large feature. It’s definitely larger in scale than Fields API, it’s like a whole new app that lives in WordPress. Integration with it has required a lot of education and trial/error. People’s focus is where it needs to be right now. It’s just unfortunate that Gutenberg came before Fields API in terms of priority and interest level.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to the next Fields API project leader?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>This is a big project, everyone will want to say it should be a certain way. You have to evaluate the options and put forth something bite sized for core to start with. Build upon that, but never lose sight of the long-term goal of integration across all of the WordPress screens. Even the front-end comment forms could thrive with the Fields API.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you feel personally responsible for the project not being a core priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>At one point, we had momentum. We had at least three to four people who were active. It fell apart because I ran out of time. It’s my shortsightedness, it’s my fault. I spent hundreds of hours developing the project over a couple of years. I should have left myself much more time for organizing the feature proposal text and keeping the fires burning in our contributors’ hearts.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Considering the time and effort you&#8217;ve put into the project the last few years, do you feel any sense of relief passing the torch on?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>If the torch gets passed or picked up, I will feel a ton better. The main relief is that it’s officially not a weight I have to carry alone any longer. It’s okay to try and fail, it’s still sad though. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that someone or some company steps up and puts time into this. They could even reignite the fire in my own heart that burned itself out. For now, I have one less major to-do item. I still have a hefty plate but it’s no longer as heavy of a burden.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<p>While the immediate future of the project is unclear, those interested in taking it over are encouraged to read posts marked with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API tag</a> on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">Make.WordPress.Core</a> to learn about its history.

His concern is that if Google succeeds, it might &#8220;make a lot of the web&#8217;s history inaccessible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Google makes a popular browser and is a tech industry leader,&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;They can, they believe, encircle the web, and at first warn users as they access HTTP content. Very likely they will do more, requiring the user to consent to open a page, and then to block the pages outright.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BTW, if I had to guess, the *real* reason Google hates HTTP has to do with Google\'s ad revenue, and not wanting Verizon and Comcast to remove their ads and replace them with their own. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61c.png\" alt=\"😜\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; scripting.com (@davewiner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1021500417241427968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others have speculated that another driving factor behind Google&#8217;s push for HTTPS adoption may be its investment in <a href=\"https://www.i-programmer.info/news/87-web-development/11367-google-starts-its-push-to-progressive-web-apps-bye-bye-chrome-apps.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advancing PWA technologies</a>, which require HTTPS to be enabled.

HTTPS is a requirement for the permission workflows, new features, and updated APIs that the company is using to build its future products.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how HTTPS is critical for e-commerce, banking, and other sites that collect highly sensitive data from users, but many wonder if it is necessary for simple blogs and content websites. Google contends that <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all websites need HTTPS protection</a> to prevent intruders from injecting ads or exploits.</p>\n<p>Few would dispute the value of HTTPS but critics are wary of Google establishing itself as the arbiter of safe browsing on the web.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My blog, <a href=\"https://t.co/gPQ9VPYOLB\">https://t.co/gPQ9VPYOLB</a>, is not “not secure.” It uses the standard protocol of the web, HTTP.

Tomorrow, this plugin will have been in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory for 13 years (it was the 339th plugin in the WordPress plugin repository; there are now over 75,000!).</p>\n<p>To celebrate its transition to a teenager, I&#8217;ve added some new features and UI enhancements.</p>\n<p>Last month, I received survey responses from over 800 Page Links To users and learned a lot about how it&#8217;s being put to work. One of the most interesting things I found was how many people are using it for URL redirects. For example, they might have a really long URL on their own site or someone else&#8217;s site that they want to be nice. <em>example.com/summer-sale</em> instead of <em>example.com/store/specials.aspx?season=summer&amp;_utm_source=internal</em>. But in order to create these redirects, you have to go through the cluttered and sometimes slow post creation screen. All you really need to create a redirect is a title, a destination URL, and a local short URL.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now find a menu item &#8220;Add Page Link&#8221; that will allow you to quickly add a redirected Page without having to wait for the entire WordPress post editing interface to load. It&#8217;s <em>super</em> fast, and it doesn&#8217;t redirect you away from the screen you&#8217;re on.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Since short URLs are better for sharing (and remembering), the UI will give you a little push to shorten the URL if the one generated from your title is too long. From there, you can Save Draft or Publish.</p>\n<img />Hey, that URL is getting a bit long\n<img />Custom slug, for a better short URL\n<p>Additionally, this release includes a &#8220;link&#8221; indicator on post and page list screens, so you can easily see what items have been re-pointed with Page Links To. When hovered, the link icon will reveal the destination URL for a quick view.</p>\n<img />The &#8220;link&#8221; icon means that this item has been pointed elsewhere.\n<p>If you want to grab the &#8220;local&#8221; short URL (which will be redirected to your chosen URL when someone visits it), just click &#8220;Copy Short URL&#8221; from the actions, and it&#8217;ll be in your clipboard.</p>\n<img />Hover the &#8220;link&#8221; icon to see where it&#8217;s pointing.\n<p>That&#8217;s it for version 3.0, but I&#8217;ll have more to announce soon — stay tuned!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 22:02:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Thoughts From Two Founders Who Recently Sold Their WordPress Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/thoughts-from-two-founders-who-recently-sold-their-wordpress-businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2299:\"<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">WP Engine acquired StudioPress</a>. Brian Gardner, founder of StudioPress, recently <a href=\"https://authentik.com/sell/\">shared his thoughts</a> on why he didn&#8217;t want to sell the business, but did. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Making a decision that not only affects your livelihood, the livelihood of your partners and employees, and the livelihood of an entire community isn’t for the faint of heart.

In the past, WordSesh has been a marathon 24-hour event, but Richards decided to pare it down to 12 hours this year in order to organize the details quickly and get the next event on the calendar as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>WordSesh Experiments with Charging Attendees for Tickets, Adds Real-Time Transcription</h3>\n<p>For the first time in WordSesh history, the event is charging attendees for tickets (rather than making it free for everyone as in years past). Richards is using the ticket money to pay speakers and have every video professionally transcribed in real-time. He has received some pushback on the decision but wants to see how things fare with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the community might get behind that so we can stop asking speakers to completely volunteer their time, and the transcriptions are a huge accessibility bonus for non-native English speakers as well as the hard of hearing,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;There have been just a few people pipe up to voice their distaste that I converted a free event to a paid event, which suggests there are many others stewing about it quietly, and I’m guessing it’s because they don’t realize where the money’s going (not that it should matter in either case).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said tickets are dynamically priced to be the operational equivalent of $25 USD in every person&#8217;s home country. In India, for example, the ticket price is closer to $9 USD. He has kept quiet about the tech until now because he didn&#8217;t want people gaming the system but has since decided that it&#8217;s not a major concern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The site accounts for purchase power parity so that the cost is not more than a couple of billable hours (or, ideally, much less) for everyone,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;And for people whom the cost of a ticket is still a stretch, well, that’s where the scholarships come in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordSesh still has 18 donated scholarships to give away but Richards said he is struggling to find people willing to apply to watch the event for free. Prospective attendees can <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/product/wordsesh-scholarship/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">apply for a scholarship or nominate others to receive one</a>.</p>\n<p>A ticket to the event grants attendees access to the sessions, both live and after it has been recorded. Attendees will also receive virtual swag. A few samples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A steep discount on WPSessions annual memberships (33%)</li>\n<li>Stripe is providing an exclusive link to skip the invitation process on their Atlas program and cover the cost for processing their first $5k of payments</li>\n<li>CorgiBytes is offering a $1k discount (~20%) on their code auditing services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous WordSesh events averaged 1,000 online attendees and a good portion of them showed up the same day the events aired. This year there are approximately 400 registered so far. Richards said he won&#8217;t rule out the possibility of making the event free again for the next edition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Asking more from sponsors could make a free event possible again without paying for everything personally (right now I&#8217;m still about $1000 in the red), but I really want to put the onus on the community at large,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Quality events take a lot of time and effort to accomplish, and most of that cost is on the backs of the organizers, speakers, and sponsors rather than attendees (at least in the WP community). Having been in all of those seats I&#8217;d really like to see more responsibility shift to the attendees. I would personally be happy to pay more for an event and be glad knowing that both speakers and organizers weren&#8217;t burning all this time in hopes of a return.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Virtual conferences have started gaining more traction in the global WordPress community after the success of previous WordSesh events. WordPress educator Zac Gordon recently hosted more than 1,000 attendees at his free <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/free-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-to-stream-live-friday-june-29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for WordPress conference</a> in June. The Polyglots&#8217; virtual <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Global WordPress Translation day</a> has also attracted hundreds of participants at each event (448 attendees in April 2016, 780 attendees in November 2016, and 1,300 local event RSVPs in September 2017).</p>\n<p>Virtual events often reach far more people than an average local WordCamp, and many also inspire in-person meetups. Watch parties for WordSesh&#8217;s 5th edition are happening in cities across the globe, including Antwerp, Lagos, Minneapolis, Mumbai, and Bar Harbor (Maine).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve always enjoyed seeing people pour in to the event each year, and there was a delightful hum throughout the WordPress community every time a WordSesh took place,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WordSesh has been a valuable addition to the virtual event space around WordPress, and attendee numbers at the upcoming event will be important for measuring how much traction the event can retain with its conversion to a paid event. Richards says he is committed to keeping the event alive and hopes to host it two times per year, which is one of the reasons for cutting it back to 12 hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m already excited for the next event,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;I’m a little concerned at the moment, only because I don’t expect this one will sell enough tickets to break even, but I’m absolutely committed to hosting WordSesh again in the future. I’m more interested in hosting an incredible event and providing a ton of value to attendees than I am in breaking even this time around.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:41:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.3 Released, Adds Archives and Recent Comments Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82478\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-3-released-adds-archives-and-recent-comments-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1354:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg 3.3</a> is available and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-july/\">continues the trend</a> of refining the user experience, user interface, and tools.

Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan with a population of more than 30 million people. Its airport connects the country to other international cities and smaller cities within Pakistan are available by rail or bus. Organizers behind the camp are overcoming a rocky history that has plagued the planning of WordPress-related events in the country for the past several years.</p>\n<p>At the close of 2015, Pakistan was on track to host its first WordCamp in Lahore, building on momentum from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-growing-in-pakistan-500-attend-lahore-meetup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenal growth of the local meetup group</a>. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/xpertone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muhammad Kashif</a>, one of the organizers, was averaging 200-500 attendees at meetups and his team&#8217;s application to host <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-pakistan-application-approved-for-2016\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Lahore was approved for 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The meetup events, which attracted young students, developers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, had grown so large that Kashif was having to close registration ahead of time because they were exceeding the capacity of the venue. Organizers expected 400-500 attendees at the WordCamp before it was cancelled after several delays near the end of the planning stage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-pakistan-wordpress-meetup-featured.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After contacting the WordPress Community team for the reason why it was cancelled, I received an official response from representative Hugh Lashbrooke:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes a WordCamp doesn’t make it all the way from pre-planning to being an actual event — occasionally due to logistical challenges, but other times because of broader concerns. In this case, once the WordCamp planning was underway, some tense dynamics arose within the local team. Everyone worked really hard to reach a positive solution, but we weren’t able to move forward with the event in the end.</p>\n<p>Cancelling an event is never anyone’s preference, to be clear, but it is also a customary response when it’s clear that collaboration isn’t possible in the short term. Local organizers are always encouraged to reapply as soon as the barriers to collaboration have been resolved.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lashbrooke also cited issues with the camp&#8217;s budget for the venue organizers selected. He said the situation was thoroughly investigated before the camp was cancelled and that they would never take that kind of decision lightly.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Lahore organizers gave me a different report on what happened and were disappointed with the decision from the Community Team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Representatives from the Foundation cancelled the camp in the last stage based on a complaint from one person out of a community of 3,000 people,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;The Foundation made a direct decision of cancellation without giving me a chance for explanation as the Primary Organizer. I suggested the Foundation conduct a survey from the whole Lahore community to know the facts but they had already made the decision to cancel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif claims there was no disagreement between the organizers, because the community member in question, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrahmadawais\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ahmad Awais</a>, was never part of the original organizing team.</p>\n<p>One member of the planning team agreed to speak to me anonymously about why he believes the camp was canceled. He claims that Awais fractured the team after his request to be given a prominent position in the organization was denied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ahmad Awais started hijacking Kashif and his team,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was not a lead organizer at all, but on the planning team. Instead of contributing, Ahmad wanted to speak at every meetup and didn’t spend time with organizing team. He broke the team and started pointing fingers at Kashif and the existing organizing team. He was NOT there until WC Lahore was approved. He joined the team after that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple leaders from WordCamp Karachi&#8217;s 14-person organizing team, who wish to remain anonymous, have reported that Awais also requested to be named keynote speaker and was unhappy with the team after they told him that speaker decisions do not work like that. Several said they feared his retaliation against the camp, given they previously had no recourse with the Community Team after the experience of WordCamp Lahore getting shut down.</p>\n<p>Awais is not attending WordCamp Karachi and has declined to answer any questions about WordCamp Lahore due to personal reasons.</p>\n<p>Kashif received hundreds of messages from the community after the event in Lahore was cancelled. He had been working since 2013 to bring a WordCamp to the area. He said that while the Community Team was helpful with other queries he had, he was disappointed with how quickly the camp was cancelled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I worked tirelessly for years to get a WordCamp to Lahore and grew the community from 430 to 2600 in one year but the Foundation didn’t even give me a chance to explain before canceling WC Lahore, Kashif said. &#8220;I am a bit disheartened by that action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif is now helping with other WordCamps, including Karachi and NYC. He is also willing to work to re-establish a WordCamp Lahore in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like me there are lots of other WordPress enthusiasts in Pakistan who want to participate in WordCamps but not everyone can do that outside of Pakistan due to financial or visa reasons,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;I was accepted as a volunteer in WordCamp Europe but couldn’t join due to visa issues. I have seen so much excitement for WordCamp Karachi in the WordPress community across the whole country. Everyone is willing to help to make it a successful event so that there are more frequent WordCamps in Pakistan. The first one is so important as it will set expectations of outcomes of a WordCamp for people who are new to these events.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Karachi Organizers Aim to Make a Positive Impact on Pakistan</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Karachi organizers are attempting to move past the Pakistani WordPress community&#8217;s checkered history of contention. They are also eager to distance themselves from the conflict that took down WordCamp Lahore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/usmankhalid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Khalid</a>, lead organizer of the camp, said he has put in a lot of effort asking organizers and volunteers to work together, regardless of the credit they will receive, and focus on the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to spend time on having a positive impact for this country, avoiding any kind of noise,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;The Pakistani WordPress community is vibrant in many ways. We have around 6,000 plus WordPressers in our community, with people who are selling their products and services worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Khalid said there are many users in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawer, and Faisalabad who are doing well with WordPress but are not yet connected to the community or participating in meetups and events. People from all over Pakistan will be attending the event as their first exposure to the WordPress community. Sessions will mostly be conducted in English but a few will be mixed with Urdu, the regional language.</p>\n<p>Khalid has experienced many growing pains in bringing the event to a community that is new to understanding how WordCamps work. In a country that is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pakistan-is-blocking-sites-hosted-on-wordpress-com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notorious for its censorship</a>, WordPress&#8217; mission of democratizing publishing has the potential to change many lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since this is first Wordcamp, many people even don&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;Those who know want to be a speaker, or any lead role that can promote them. When we tell them it doesn&#8217;t work like this, they are mostly get annoyed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tech publications around Pakistan have not been exposed to WordCamps either. Khalid said several of them have asked for money in order to cover the story of the event, unaware that the purpose of the camps and meetups is not to translate everything into business but to give back to the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am simply working to actually deliver first and prove that this community can create a positive impact,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;I am sure after Wordcamp Karachi, the entire community within Pakistan will flourish, regardless of what happened in Lahore.&#8221; He said he hopes the next camps will be even more interesting in the future and that WordCamp Karachi will help to create new jobs and more businesses in Pakistan.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:14:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: Why the makers of Ninja Forms are getting into eCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=46627\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/why-the-makers-of-ninja-forms-are-getting-into-ecommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1982:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

WordPress 4.9.7 increased the number of times it calls the wp_is_stream() function generating the error more often.</p>\n\n<p>After thoughtful conversations within the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532#comment:46\">trac ticket</a>, a patch was created that after further testing, was committed to core. ﻿<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532#comment:46\">According to Gary Pendergast</a>, the patch does the following.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n	<p>Bailing if the path isn&#8217;t a stream. This isn&#8217;t perfect: it&#8217;s still possible to trigger the PHP bug, but it does significantly reduce the chances of the bug being encountered. For many WordPress sites (those that don&#8217;t have plugins that use streams), it reduces the chance to zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you encountered memory exhaustion errors after installing or upgrading to WordPress 4.9.7, try <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/19/wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2/\">WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2</a> to see if it fixes the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from coming up with a solution, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532\">Trac ticket #44532</a> is a bit refreshing to see. In open source, tickets or issues can get bogged down with suggestions, hypothetical scenarios, and bike-shed commentary.</p>\n\n<p>In this instance, the issue was identified and folks from the community along with core contributors worked together in a focused fashion to create a fix in time for the next point release.

The page counter wouldn&#8217;t increment.</p>\n\n<p>When a cookie banner is clicked a cookie is set in the browser so the website knows this visitor has agreed to accept cookies. If the cookie is set then the cookie banner html is not sent to the browser.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the main issue is that the code that sets and checks if the cookie is set is PHP. Unfortunately because the page is cached then no PHP code is executed, and the cookie banner is displayed because it was originally cached that way.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Since WP Super Cache only knows about certain WordPress cookies it assumes everyone who doesn&#8217;t have those cookies is a first time &#8220;anonymous&#8221; visitor. It doesn&#8217;t know about your cookie banner cookie.<br /></p>\n\n<p>You have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Rewrite your cookie banner so it&#8217;s completely in Javascript. Do the cookie detection in Javascript and also set the cookie in Javascript. If the cookie banner has been clicked then you need to trigger an action, and other Javascript that is hooked on to that trigger will run and load the tracking cookies.</li>\n	<li>Modify WP Super Cache so it knows about the cookie your cookie banner uses. Caching won&#8217;t work quite as well as before as it&#8217;ll be split between visitors who have clicked the cookie banner and those that haven&#8217;t. One cached file will display the cookie banner, and the other will not but it will have ad tracking Javascript.<br /></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Using Javascript completely is a better solution because it runs in the browser on every page load but that might not be possible every time.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, use PHP to get WP Super Cache to play nicely with your existing code:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>You&#8217;ll need to write a <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2017/10/25/writing-wp-super-cache-plugins/\">WP Super Cache plugin</a>.</li>\n	<li>You need to hook into the wp_cache_get_cookies_values cacheaction and add the value of the cookie banner cookie to the end of that string.</li>\n	<li>Caching can only be performed by <em>simple</em> caching now, unless you&#8217;re willing to edit mod_rewrite rules in your .htaccess file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Something like this will do. Make sure you note the warning about <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> in the link above about writing these plugins.<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function add_cookie_banner_to_cache_cookie( $string ) {\n    if ( isset( $_COOKIE[\'cookie_banner\'] ) ) {\n        $string .= \'cb,\';\n    }\n    return $string\n}\nadd_cacheaction( \'wp_cache_get_cookies_values\', \'add_cookie_banner_to_cache_cookie\' );</code></pre>\n\n<p>Substitute the name of the cookie for your cookie name, change the name of the function, and the text it adds to the string. There is an intentional PHP fatal error in the code above to discourage copy/pasting.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Your cookie banner plugin could automate setting this up, but it may have unforeseen consequences if not done correctly. It should check if <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> is set already, and use that location, otherwise it will have to make a directory and update the WP Super Cache configuration, where ABC is the new location for the plugins.<br /></p>\n\n<p><code>wp_cache_setting( \'wp_cache_plugins_dir\', ABSPATH . \'wp-content/ABC\' );﻿</code></p>\n\n<p>The new code can be copied into a file in that directory. The files in the original WP Super Cache plugins directory (found at <code>WPCACHEHOME . \'plugins\'</code>) should be copied into that directory too and a warning shown to the user. They may need to set up one of those plugins again.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The reason it is this convoluted is because this code will run before all of WordPress loads. You can&#8217;t rely on blog options or most of the nice configuration tools WordPress provides.<br /></p>\n\n<p>When your plugin is uninstalled it should of course restore the plugins directory to the way it was before.</p>\n\n<p>For future reference, since cookie banners will hopefully not be around forever, here&#8217;s what they looked like in the deep, distant past of 2018. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n	The LA Times just gave up and don&#8217;t show anything to EU visitors.\n\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2003/08/12/linuxie-and-free-software-projects/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Linux.ie and free software projects\">Linux.ie and free software projects</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/03/06/please-sir-can-i-have-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Please sir, can I have more?\">Please sir, can I have more?</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/2018/07/20/wp-super-cache-and-cookie-banners/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 13:33:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: First Look at “Try Gutenberg” Prompt in WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-try-gutenberg-prompt-in-wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3384:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/19/wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2</a> was released today, featuring the new &#8220;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Try Gutenberg</a>&#8221; prompt that will appear in user dashboards when the official release drops at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>The prompt invites users to install Gutenberg if they want to try the new editor or install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> to keep using the current editor until they are ready to make the change. WordPress contributors discussed variations on the design and wording of the callout and finally settled on what you see in 4.9.8 Beta 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-4.02.56-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Even if users don&#8217;t get involved in Gutenberg testing, the callout serves to inform them that the new editor will be enabled by default in the next major release of WordPress. It includes a link to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg information page</a> so users can learn more about the project.</p>\n<p>Contributors agreed that they wanted to clearly communicate three important points in the callout, as per designer @kjellr&#8217;s <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:148\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggestions on trac</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gutenberg is coming in the next major release.</li>\n<li>If you’re worried about compatibility, there’s a plugin to help ease the transition.</li>\n<li>The plugin lets you use the editor you’re used to until you’re ready to switch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The prompt is clearly geared towards encouraging users to test Gutenberg, as that section has a more prominent, colored button. If your clients&#8217; installations are not ready for users to act on the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt, now is the time to install a plugin that will disable it. Clients with free-range of the WordPress admin, in sites that are running Gutenberg-compatible extensions, are better candidates for testing the new editor.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-classic-editor-addon-plugin-disables-the-try-gutenberg-prompt-coming-in-wordpress-4-9-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor Addon</a> is one option that will suppress the prompt and automatically suppress Gutenberg when it ships in WordPress 5.0. It was also recently updated to auto-install the Classic Editor plugin as a dependency so users don&#8217;t have to install two plugins as part of the process.</p>\n<p>A release candidate is slated for July 24, and the official 4.9.8 release is scheduled for July 31st. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin</a> is currently sitting at 10,000+ active installations and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> at 5,000+.

Whereas in Spain, for example, they had 11 WordCamps this year that are more local and smaller. As a German community we are more used to traveling to a central place and meeting there.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What to Expect at WCEU in Berlin: A Diverse Community, More Workshops, and a Unique After Party</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.estrel.com/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Estrel Hotel and Congress Center</a> will host the entire event, including both conference days, the contributor day, and the after party. Although the venue has a max capacity of 12,000 people, Kau said organizers are planning for 2,500 &#8211; 3,000 attendees. The local team is excited to introduce the European WordPress community to their home city.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Berlin is one of the most diverse cities in Europe,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;When I prepared the application, I figured out that there are people from 191 countries living in Berlin. It&#8217;s a very international, very diverse city, so you can be just as you are and feel quite comfortable and welcome in Berlin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kau said organizers intend to continue with workshops as a part of the event in 2019 but they are planning to make the signup experience more efficient.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was the first year we tried workshops,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;We had three workshop tracks and workshops of 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and three hours. We are not sure how many workshops we want to have in Berlin. The idea was new but turned out quite well. There were workshops with many people waiting to get in and from what I&#8217;ve heard it was quite good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kau said he wants to improve the process for workshops, because there was no easy way for attendees to sign up and managing waiting lists was a lot of manual work for the content team.
